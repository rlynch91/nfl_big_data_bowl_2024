    "For example, in the above play, the model would only expect Indianapolis to lose 0.04 in predicted EPA if it were to instead run a play to the right sideline (R3) behind its highest-graded blocker Michael Pittman (#11); this is a 0.2 EPA improvement on a single play call.\n",
    "ROPM and RDPM are not end-all statistics:  e.g., they are potentially vulnerable to biases introduced by scheme and player responsibility.\n",
    "But their model could prove to be a useful complement to film study, identifying and quantifying statistical trends for further follow-up."

    "When running the EM algorithm to find the maximum-likelihood GMM describing a dataset, one must specify the number of classes used in the mixture model.\n",
    "Even though there is complete freedom in this choice, model selection can be performed to find the optimal number of classes according to some criteria.\n",
    "In our analysis, model selection consists of minimizing the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which penalizes models according to their number of free parameters (here, the number of classes in the GMM) in order to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "In some sense, its minimization finds \"the minimum number of classes needed to describe the data well.\"\n",
    "As shown below, we find that the rushing trajectories included in our fitting sample are best described using 7 unique rushing classes in the GMM."

    "The multivariate linear regression we perform to estimate ROPM and RDPM involves the minimization of a quadratic loss function, meaning the estimated regression coefficients are susceptible to being heavily influenced by outlier values if not properly handled.\n",
    "In order to limit the extent to which outliers can dominate our estimation, we clip the values of EPA used in our sample to lie within the range (-3,3).\n",
    "This approximately corresponds to clipping outlier values of EPA down to the 1% and 99% quantiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two free parameters in the regression model that need to be jointly tuned.\n",
    "The relevant model selection is performed by maximizing the out-of-sample $R^2$ of a 3-fold cross-validation with a 67%-33% train-test split for each fold. \n",
    "This 3-fold cross-validation allows us to use all available data (i.e., weeks 1-9 of the 2022 NFL season) in our fits while still evaluating model performance on out-of-sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first free parameter is the $\\lambda$ \"max-speed\" threshold mentioned above, which dictates the radius of a player's influence as a function of the time from snap. \n",
    "After experimenting with global versus position-specific values of $\\lambda$, we find that a global value of 2.6 yards/second provides the best-fitting model. \n",
    "The second free parameter is a standard Tikhonov (a.k.a., L2 or ridge) regularization term, whose best-fit scale parameter is roughly 300.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intercept parameter of the best-fit model takes a value of -0.03, reflecting the slightly negative expected value of EPA for the rushing plays included in the fitting sample.\n",
    "Although ROPM and RDPM values exist for every participating NFL player, in this analysis we only share the results for players that participated in at least 80 rushing plays.\n",
    "This threshold is chosen to select the primary participants for each team, and it corresponds to players that had a bye week during weeks 1-9 of the 2022 NFL season participating in an average of at least 10 rushing plays per game over the interval.\n",
    "Due to their sparsity, we group players whose position is FB into the TE category when displaying results; however, we emphasize that this choice has no effect on the regression itself or the resulting ROPM and RDPM values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The $R^2$ of the best-fit model on the out-of-sample test data is 0.3%, which roughly corresponds to a positive correlation of 5.5% between the actual and predicted EPA on a per-play basis.\n",
    "This value has the expected magnitude:  it is comparable to the predictive correlation of 4.8% needed to be profitable against the NFL spread in expectation ([proof given here](https://github.com/rlynch91/nfl_big_data_bowl_2024/blob/main/R2_Needed_to_Beat_NFL_Spread.ipynb)), another NFL-points prediction problem.\n",
    "The $R^2$ value can likely be improved by scaling the regression variables by an EPA-volatility model that incorporates down, distance, and field position information; however, the leading-order effect of this change would likely be a global up/down-scaling of the ROPM and RDPM coefficients rather than a reordering of the coefficient ranks among players.\n",
    "We can proxy a test of this assertion by varying our clipping range for EPA to in turn vary the influence of high-volatility regimes on the regression results, and we generally observe player ordering to be preserved when doing so.\n",
    "Because player ranking and model interpretability are the primary goals of this analysis, we leave model improvements of a similar vein to future work."
